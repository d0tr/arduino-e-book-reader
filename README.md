# arduino-e-reader

This is my take on a microcontroller e-book reader using the stuff I had laying around.
Since I did not have a bigger screen at hand I decided to add auto scrolling with changeable speed values while keeping the option to scroll manually.

## Future ideas

* Working on EEPROM to save the current page after reading

# Needed things
* 16x2 LCD Display using a I2C Module
* A Push Button
* A 4x4 Keypad
* According cables to connect the items
* (Keep in mind that the Pins may differ due to having different hardware)

## Required Libraries

* [Keypad](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/keypad)
* [Liquid Crystal I2C](https://andatche.com/code/arduino/lcd03/)
